MyTaste

A personalized dining experience powered by AI

About Us

MyTaste is a revolutionary app designed to connect users with restaurants that match their individual tastes and preferences. Founded by Louis Bugge Lamptey and Arthur Toppenberg, our mission is to enhance restaurant guest experiences through AI-driven analytics and a user-focused approach to dining discovery. Through MyTaste, users create a personalized "Taste" profile based on their culinary preferences, which allows them to discover new dining options tailored to their unique tastes.

Vision and Mission

Our vision is to transform the restaurant industry by bridging the gap between data, technology, and personal interaction. MyTaste serves as more than a dining recommendation app; it is a community of food lovers who can share and explore curated recommendations.

For Users: MyTaste offers a personalized, AI-powered experience, where users can connect with restaurants that fit their preferences. With features inspired by social media platforms, users can save restaurants, write reviews, follow profiles with similar tastes, and receive more refined recommendations over time as the AI learns from their interactions.
For Restaurants: MyTaste provides detailed insights based on user feedback, helping restaurants improve their service, atmosphere, and offerings. Restaurants receive weekly and monthly reports with actionable insights derived from customer reviews, enabling them to address specific feedback (e.g., noise levels or meal seasoning) and improve the guest experience continuously.
Unique Features

AI-Driven Personalization: Users create profiles to specify their taste preferences, such as favorite dishes, preferred dining atmosphere, budget, and service expectations.
